This repo will store my shortcut workflow for Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a potent flashcard software for learning anything. In particular, I will focus on optimizing the technique of cloze deletion, wherein multiple parts of flashcards are demarcated ("clozed") such that any demarcated part could be occluded on a given flashcard generation. Tl;dr: it's like fill-in-the-blank (https://willpeachmd.com/anki-cloze).
